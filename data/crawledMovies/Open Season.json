  "description": "A happily domesticated grizzly bear named Boog (Martin Lawrence), has his perfect world turned upside down after he meets Elliot (Ashton Kutcher), a scrawny, fast-talking one-horned wild mule deer. They both end up stranded together in the woods during hunting season and it's up to the duo to rally all of the other forest animals and turn the tables on the hunters.",
