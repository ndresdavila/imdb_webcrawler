As Bond pursues the agents of an assassination attempt on M, all roads lead to Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric), a world-renowned developer of green technology. Greene, a nasty piece of work, is intent on securing a barren area of Bolivia in exchange for assisting a strongman stage a coup there. The C.I.A. looks the other way, and only Bond, with help from a retired spy and from a mysterious beauty, stands in Greene's way. M wonders if she can trust Bond, or if vengeance possesses him.
