  "description": "Having already missed his wedding to his beautiful sweetheart, Sara, twice, the happy, absent-minded professor, Dr Phillip Brainard, is struggling to come up with a brilliant invention to save Medfield College from closure. However, as good things come to those who wait, the eccentric inventor stumbles upon an innovative but highly unstable formula for \"Flubber\", a mysterious rubber-like hybrid elastomer that can lift objects, bouncing and stretching as if it had a mind of its own. Of course, this unique but untamed creation catches the attention of a ruthless rival who is bent on getting his hands on the extraordinary substance. But first, he will have to catch it. Can Dr Brainard protect his invention?",
