  "description": "The once hideous ogre Shrek (Mike Myers) is now living a good life with wife Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and his three children. But he soon has a meltdown in front of them and his friends during his kids' birthday party. He suddenly wants to be a real ogre like he was before he ever met Fiona. So he turns to devious dealmaker Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohrn) for help. At first, Shrek lives the life he once lost and everything is good. But he soon finds out that he has been set up by Rumpelstiltskin, who now rules the land with an iron fist. Teaming with friends Donkey (Eddie Murphy), Fiona, and Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas), Shrek is in for the fight of his life as he tries to get his life back before time runs out.",
